# A-B-Testing

This was the last project in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, I designed an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. I also analyzed the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity, recommended a decision, and proposed a follow-up experiment.
